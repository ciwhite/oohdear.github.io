	<p>Just so you know how it works, every time I add a new post it appears here. if I had more things to say and wasnt brain dead from trying to get this website to work I would mention them now but I am tired and the all is in your court. </p>

	<h2>Cormac - 9/9/20</h2>  
	<p>Hello all, This is my first confession. Seems like texting is a rather useless form of longterm communication, and although I would be lost without Ciaran sending shite history memes into the group at 3 in the morning, I think I might have a better idea. in the about section ( top right) I've made a tutorial of how you guys can add content to this website. If you curious about what to add, think along the lines of - What are you doing that you would like to share with the group that takes to long to explain in a text, or what would the guys be interested in knowing. for example i would be really interested if jack wrote a piece about some cool part of architecture that none of us are aware of but he could summarize nicely, or if ali had links to some cool shit or T has some philosophical thoughts he wants to share. yes it's a blog. Just add what the fuck you like as per the tutorial</p>
